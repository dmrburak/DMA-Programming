In CubeIDE, the Memory View window does not automatically update in real-time as the program runs. Instead, it updates the displayed memory content when the program execution is halted, such as at a breakpoint or when manually pausing the debugger. This behavior is a common characteristic of many IDEs and debugging tools, including CubeIDE, due to performance and technical considerations.
